# Unlock Hidden Bone Rotation Properties
There are hidden and locked x,y,z rotation properties on every bone of Daz G3 and G8.  

With those properties locked, you won't import any pose or motion data onto G3 and G8 correctly.  

So, you have to unhide them, then unlock them on every bone for every character. That's insane.  
Now, this script can do it for you. Just select your G3, G8 character, and run this script. Done.  Then, you can import pose or animation data.
