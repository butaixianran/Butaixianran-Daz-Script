How to use
================
Prepare
-------------
* Copy script to your Daz Lib's script folder
* In Daz Studio, find this script from Content Library, right click it, select: "Create Custom action", click "Accept".
* Now this script can be run from menu->Scripts
* Thumbnail size is 256x256, if you like 512x512 better, you can just edit script, change "thumbnailSize"'s value from 256 to 512.


Use it
---------------
* This script offers 2 choices:
    - Create Iray thumbnail for current scene
    - Or, for a file you selected from Content Library

* It will save your render setting, then change render setting to render a 256x256 png image as thumbnail.
* After that, it will restore your render setting.
* Right click your file, select "Refresh" to check the result.

* If you don't run this script as Custom Action, after you click this script, your selected file will always be this script.
