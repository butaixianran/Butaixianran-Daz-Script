Intro
====================
Name: ContentRemover
Version: 0.3
Descr:
Select a product file in Content Library, then this script will Remove the Whole Product From Disk, including all related files and folders in data and runtime folder. So you can clean your Content Library very easily.



Notice:
* This script will try to avoid any delete operation on Genesis x Base folders and library base folders. But there are some bad and old products, may link to an official folder I may not know. 
So, even I tested this script again and again, use it at your own risk.


* In a few cases, nothing gonna happen after you running this script. That's because the product you selected has an info.duf file, and its content is not json data, so this script failed to parse it.
Just delete this info.duf file, then run this script again.




Tips:
* Run this script from Script IDE Pan will show all the details about which folders are handled.



How to use
================
Prepare
-------------
* Copy script to your Daz Lib's script folder
* In Daz Studio, find this script from Content Library, right click it, select: "Create Custom action", click "Accept".
* Now this script can be run from menu->Scripts

* If you don't run this script as Custom Action, after you click this script, your selected file will always be this script.


Use it
---------------
* Select a product file you want to delete from content library.
* Select this script from Menu->Script
* Then this product will be removed with its images, data, uv and morph files.
